## Description
This application, Employee Tracker, allows the user to use the command line to view, add, or update information for departments, roles and employees within a company's database. The application will prompt the user with questions that they can answer using their terminal, which will then dynamically update subsequent information based on the user's resonses (e.g., if the user entered a department name, then went to view all departments, their entry will be captured).

## Installation
For installation, the user will use their command line (Terminal, Bash, etc.) and make sure they are accessing the correct index.js file that's being run. The user can then type in 'node index.js' or 'node index' in the command line. The command line will then begin asking the user questions that they can either use the arrow keys to select, or type directly if prompted for names and sarlary information. For this homework's requirements, the README includes a walkthrough video which can be viewed [here](LINK).

## Usage 
The application helps a company update, delete, or add information into a company's database in an easy and dynamic way. For example, the user can answer prompts and see their results as tables in the command line for:
- ‘View all departments’: table will display department names and department IDs
- ‘View all roles’: table shows job title, role id, department that the role belongs to, and salary for that role
- ‘View all employees’: table shows employee IDs, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and manager that  each employee reports to
- ‘Add a department’: the name of the new department in the database
- 'Add a role’: name, salary, and department for the additional role in the database
- 'Add an employee’: the employee’s first name, last name, role, and manager are added to the database
- ‘Update an employee role’: see employees and update their role into the database
